// 1. Assign an object to the variable tanniesRecipe.

// 2. The keys in this object should be sugar, butter, eggs, walnuts, secretIngredient1, secretIngredient2, secretIngredient3 and set the values to whatever you like. (Example: "1 cup", "2 pounds", "A lot", etc.)

// 3. Add a key to this object called bakingInstructions and set it equal to another object. Make the keys step1, step2, step3, step4, step5, and step6. Set the values to whatever you think the recipe requires :-)

// Leave some space.

// 4. Assign a new object to the variable `playlist` â€” the keys will be artist names and the values will be song titles. Make one example artist with an example song. 

// 5. Create a function `updatePlaylist` that accepts three parameters: the playlist (an object), an artist name (a string), and a song title. The body of the function should add the song and artist as a key-value pair to the playlist object. The function should return the whole playlist.
// Remember to return the playlist!

// 6. Create a function `removeFromPlaylist` that accepts two arguments (the playlist object and the artist name). The body of the function should delete the key-value pair from the playlist and return the updated playlist.
// Remember to return the playlist!
